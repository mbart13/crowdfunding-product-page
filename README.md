### Setup

To run this project, install it locally using npm:

```
npm install && npm start
```

To run Storybook:

```
npm run storybook
```

## My process

### Built with

- React
- Styled Components
- CountUp.js

### What I learned

I learned how to build modals from scratch without any libraries. Modal is accessible, user can navigate around the page and make a pledge using only keyboard.

For the first time I used atomic design methodology to structure the project and I will utilize it in my next bigger challenge to practice it more.

I used some simple animations to display the statistics in more interesting way.

Finally, I played a bit with Storybook in this project to document components in isolation and must say this is very useful tool and would like to use its full potential in a bigger project.

### Continued development

Learn more about accessible modals for screen readers.
Learn Jest to create unit tests.
